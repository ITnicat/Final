					<h1>Chicken</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="text1">
					<p>Buying chicken can be a tricky task to do. While buying chicken, make sure the chicken parts are tender, moist and plump. The whole chicken and its parts should have a clean smell. Before buying the chicken don't forget to check the date of package and don't buy if there is too much volume of liquid in the package or the chicken seems to be sticky or smells suspicion. The colour of the chicken however isn't really an accurate indicator of the quality as it varies from region to region and depends on the breed and feed of it. However whatever the colour of the chicken is, it shouldn't appear to be transparent or mottled.</p>

					<h1>Beef</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="text2">
					<p>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the leek whites, carrot and celery in a flameproof casserole dish with the butter, oil and a pinch of salt, and soften, without colouring, over a gentle heat. When the veg is soft, stir in the bacon lardons, turn up the heat a little and cook until everything is golden. Stir in the mince, followed by the flour, 3 thyme sprigs, Worcestershire sauce and Marmite. Gradually stir in the stock and bring everything to a simmer, then cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2 hrs until the sauce is thickened and rich, and the beef tender, removing the lid and stirring in the leek greens halfway through.</p>

Blend the mixture into the rice. Center one sheet nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, and imitation crabmeat in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</p>
